// Origin is divided into three parts
// 1. Protocol: What is being used to communicate with a web server
// 2. Host: It tells us which server we're going to be communicating with
// 3. Port: where the application we want to access lives in the server

// Same Origin Policy:
// Restricts what you're allowed to load when you're browsing the internet

// CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing):
// It's a way of relaxing the restrictions that the same origin policy puts on us developers.
// CORS allows for whitelisting, which is the practice of explicitly allowing access to a particular privilege or service. it is the opposite of blacklisting.

// Acces-Control-Allow-Origin header:
// This is use dto whitelist
